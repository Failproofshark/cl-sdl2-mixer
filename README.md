# cl-sdl2-mixer

This is the **very beginning** of a wrap for SDL2_mixer.  Autowrap
scaffolding is done, the library loaded, and the basic init/quit,
open/close, and similar functions are implemented.

This will not actually *play audio* yet, but implementing the
functions to do so is trivial and in the works.  Feel free to jump in!
